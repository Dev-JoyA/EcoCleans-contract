# ü™ô EcoCleans Smart Contract

The **EcoCleans** contract is a **decentralized application (dApp)** that allows users to **recycle items in exchange for U2U coins**.  
It also includes an **e-commerce component**, where recycled materials can be transformed into various **eco-green products**.

---

## üß± Contract Structure

The main contract is implemented in **`EcoCleans.sol`** and inherits functionality from the following Solidity files:

- **`User.sol`** ‚Äì Handles user registration and management.
- **`Admin.sol`** ‚Äì Manages administrative privileges and operations.
- **`Product.sol`** ‚Äì Defines product-related logic and marketplace interactions.

## Installation
To install the project 
- Go to your terminal
- cd into a folder {Desktop folder}
- run 
```shell
  git clone https://github.com/ecoCleans/ecoCleans-contract.git
```
- open the folder on Vscode 
- go to your terminal
- run
```shell
  npm install
```
**check Hardhat.config.cjs for all necessary keys you need to set**
- set all your necessary keys in your terminal using vars e.g 

```shell
  npx hardhat vars set ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
```


## ‚öôÔ∏è Compilation

To compile the contracts, run:

```shell
npx hardhat compile
```

## üîß Hardhat Configuration

The **`hardhat.config.js`** (or **`hardhat.config.ts`**) file contains key project configurations, including:

- **RPC URL** for the U2U Nebulas test network.  
- **Solidity compiler settings.**  
- **Etherscan verification setup** (with the **U2UScan** custom chain URL).  

## üöÄ Deployment

The contract is deployed using **Hardhat Ignition** on the **U2U Nebulas Test Network**.

Run the following command to deploy and verify:

```shell
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/EcoCleans.cjs  --network nebulas --deployment-id u2u-deployment --verify 
```

**Details:**

- **Deployment Tool:** `Hardhat Ignition`  
- **Network Name:** `nebulas`  
- **Deployment ID:** `u2u-deployment`
