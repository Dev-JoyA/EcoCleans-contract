# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/PicknGet.cjs  --network nebulas --deployment-id u2u-deployment
```

## deployed Address
```shell
Deployed Addresses

PicknGetModule#PicknGet - 0x2001f7f7112FB0e7DeC73586f494c6dEcB790636
```

## verified Address
```shell
   https://testnet.u2uscan.xyz/address/0x2001f7f7112FB0e7DeC73586f494c6dEcB790636#code
